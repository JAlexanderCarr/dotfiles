# Welcome to my Dotfiles!

This repository holds all my dotfiles that are used for setting up a new device.  There are 2 architectures available, amd64 and arm64.  Either can be installed using the command below, which will setup a brand new debian system in just a few minutes!

```
make setup_debian-amd64

OR -- Depending on system architecture

make setup_debian-arm64
```
